Welcome to the new blog.

That's right, I'm running my own blog *once again*. I know, I know. It's been a while. And I've picked *yet another* platform for hosting my blog. But you know what? You're just going to have to suck it up. I've been itching to make some new posts for a while now, and the platforms at my disposal, *cough* *G+* *cough*, just haven't really cut it. Sure, they sorta worked, but with the recent direction that platform is headed? Forget it.

So then a coworker mentioned standing up _his_ new blog using [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and I was blown away at how it worked. It just *so totally fit* with my workflow and preferences. So here we are. Everything old is new again. Or something.
