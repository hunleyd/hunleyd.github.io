However, you&#39;re probably <em>not</em> running it incrementally throughout the day. Most likely, you&#39;ve setup a <code>cron.daily</code> job that runs pgBadger against yesterday&#39;s log(s). And that&#39;s great. Except when you get the dreaded &quot;what just happened on the db?&quot; email. Are you going to wait until tonight&#39;s normal run of pgBadger to see what happened? Are you going to run a &#39;one off&#39; pgBadger against today&#39;s logfile and wait for it to process the <em>entire</em> log? Or are you going to copy the log off somewhere, edit it to cut it down, and <em>then</em> run pgBadger against this cut-down version (hoping you left enough in the log to see proper trending)?</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>After an afternoon dicking around with Jekyll templates and Google serching, I&#39;ve fixed up this site&#39;s archive pages and tag cloud pages. I now have functional archive pages for everything, each year, each month of said year, and each day of said month. And they should all continue to function perfectly well on their own as time progresses (unless I bork something up later trying to be clever). I&#39;ve also modified the tag cloud page to fit in the archive pages&#39; look an feel. It&#39;s not a true tag cloud in that I don&#39;t increae the weight or height of the font based on frequency, but the cloud does contain every tag used across the blog and each tag has it&#39;s own page showing all posts tagged as such.</p>

And for the most part, it&#39;s worked really well for me. I <em>really</em> like Android N so far and can&#39;t wait for the final release. However, after updating from Developer Preview 1 (DP1) to Developer Preview 2 (DP2) via OTA, I noticed two small issues. The first issue is that I could not, for the life of me, get Now On Tap to enable even though it was previously enabled on DP1.</p>
