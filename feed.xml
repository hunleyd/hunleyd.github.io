   <title>I Have The Power</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.snappower.com/snaprays-guidelight/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.snappower.com/wp-content/themes/enfold-child/images/guidelight_review.jpg&quot; border=0 align=left height=262 width=262&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A while back, I ran across a little project on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com&quot;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; from a company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snappower.com&quot;&gt;SnapPower&lt;/a&gt;. The project was for a product called Guidelights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m a &amp;quot;big boy&amp;quot; and don&amp;#39;t need a night light, but I do wander around the house after dark quite a bit and hate turning on the lights when I&amp;#39;m in a room for like a whole minute. So The concept of having LED lights embedded into the outlet cover and having them turn on/off based on the ambient light in the room sounded pretty cool. And the fact that there&amp;#39;s no wiring or anything was slick. So I ponied up and ordered some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gotta tell you, they rock! I now have one in the upstairs hallyway, another at the bottom of the stairs, and a third on the island in the kitchen. It&amp;#39;s freaking perfect. Seriously. And like I said, there&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;no skill involved&lt;/em&gt;. If you can work a flat head screwdriver, you can install these!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, when Stephanie movies into her apartment (soonish), I&amp;#39;ll be outfitting her place with a few of these as well. They&amp;#39;re really that good,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Review: ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.snappower.com/snappower-chargers/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.snappower.com/wp-content/themes/enfold-child/images/charger_review.jpg&quot; border=0 align=left height=262 width=262&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As much as I love the guidelights, I was stoked when SnapPower announced their Snap Power Chargers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what it&amp;#39;s like in your household, but all four of us have smart phones, three of us have tablets, and two of us have smart watches. Someone &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; needs to charge something. And my family is &lt;strong&gt;horrible&lt;/strong&gt; about removing their chargers from outlets when they&amp;#39;re done. And one person in particular has taken to unplugging whatever is &amp;quot;in the way&amp;quot; so she can charge her phone close to wherever she&amp;#39;s sitting! Clearly, a solution that adds USB ports and frees up electrical outlets is a solution I need to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I eagerly bought &lt;em&gt;five&lt;/em&gt; of these things. I installed all but one yesterday, and I gotta say it is as good of an investment as the light covers. I will be installing a few of these in Steph&amp;#39;s apartment also. Now, I&amp;#39;ll grant you that they are not &amp;quot;quick charge&amp;quot;. And there&amp;#39;s only one USB facing the right side of the cover instead of one on both the left and right. But I understand there&amp;#39;s only so much room in these things, and only so much power you can leech off the contacts. So I&amp;#39;m not terribly upset. It would be nice though if you could choose left or right when ordering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I&amp;#39;m kinda stoked to see what this company comes up with next. Of all the random crap I&amp;#39;ve backed on Kickstarter, SnapPower is easily the most useful and easiest to recommend to others.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s right, I&amp;#39;m running my own blog &lt;em&gt;once again&lt;/em&gt;. I know, I know. It&amp;#39;s been a while. And I&amp;#39;ve picked &lt;em&gt;yet another&lt;/em&gt; platform for hosting my blog. But you know what? You&amp;#39;re just going to have to suck it up. I&amp;#39;ve been itching to make some new posts for a while now, and the platforms at my disposal, &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;G+&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;, just haven&amp;#39;t really cut it. Sure, they sorta worked, but with the recent direction that platform is headed? Forget it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then a coworker mentioned standing up &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; new blog using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and I was blown away at how it worked. It just &lt;em&gt;so totally fit&lt;/em&gt; with my workflow and preferences. So here we are. Everything old is new again. Or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/poster.jpg&quot; border=0 alt=&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s that kinda blog&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a bit of a busy day for me and my blog. I&amp;#39;ve added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an RSS feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an archive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disqus comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All with as little effort on my part as I&amp;#39;ve &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; put into a blog. I &lt;strong&gt;fucking&lt;/strong&gt; love this blogging platform!&lt;/p&gt;
