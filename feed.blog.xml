    <title>Changes to the blog</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.cafecowboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/blogging-inside.gif&quot; border =0 align=right style=&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px&quot; height=200 width=200&gt;In case you haven&amp;#39;t already noticed, I&amp;#39;ve made some changes to my blog recently. Nothing really significant or drastic, but things that have been on the TODO list for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the most obvious change would be that I added pagination finally. If you scroll the homepage all the way down, instead of it going back through the entire blog&amp;#39;s history, it stops after five posts, and then gives a clickable page counter. Once I had this implemented, I then had to un-paginate the archive pages which was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next most visible change would probably be the change I made to the CSS concerning CODE and CODEBLOCK. I&amp;#39;m still not 100% sure this is the final form, but I like it better than it was. For reference, it now looks like &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My third change was to tweak the site&amp;#39;s header a bit. If you cast your gaze upwards, you can see that I now have &amp;#39;About&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Archive&amp;#39;, and &amp;#39;Feeds&amp;#39; in the header. The &amp;#39;Feeds&amp;#39; link is new, as is the page that it links to. The actual RSS feeds themselves have existed for a while now, I just didn&amp;#39;t announce them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, I swapped out my photo for my new Bitmoji-based avatar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, uh, enjoy. Or something.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Making use of gists</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5yjV3rrAvHk/U6Gm4-prTPI/AAAAAAAAJf4/7HXcjGxXGxI/s1600/logo_github_gist.png&quot; align=right border=0 width=218 height=59&gt; After stumbling upon an example of how to do so, I&amp;#39;ve converted all my existing blog posts to use GitHub Gists instead of inline code blocks. It gives me added functionality, and reduces the size of the blog pages as well. Might as well use every GitHub feature I can since I&amp;#39;ve chosen that platform for hosting my blog, right? :)&lt;/p&gt;
