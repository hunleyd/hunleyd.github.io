                <p>Welcome to the new blog.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right, I&#39;m running my own blog <em>once again</em>. I know, I know. It&#39;s been a while. And I&#39;ve picked <em>yet another</em> platform for hosting my blog. But you know what? You&#39;re just going to have to suck it up. I&#39;ve been itching to make some new posts for a while now, and the platforms at my disposal, <em>cough</em> <em>G+</em> <em>cough</em>, just haven&#39;t really cut it. Sure, they sorta worked, but with the recent direction that platform is headed? Forget it.</p>

<p>So then a coworker mentioned standing up <em>his</em> new blog using <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and I was blown away at how it worked. It just <em>so totally fit</em> with my workflow and preferences. So here we are. Everything old is new again. Or something.</p>
