The rest of this post still sands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lleader&quot; src=&quot;http://www.awesome-t-shirts.com/img/T-shirts/you-look-different-not-better-just-different.jpg&quot; /&gt;As you’ve probably noticed, I’ve launched the new blog design. Everything that was here should still be here, but it might have moved. Sorry, but I broke the old permalinks. Bad blogger! However, I now have everything &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; where I want it, so it shouldn’t ever change again. Famous last words, right there :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway, let me know if you find issues w/ the site. I’m aware of some small CSS fuckery here and there, but I got tired of beating my head against it honestly. If anyone wants to tell me what’s wrong with it and how to fix it, I’ll buy you a virtual beer. If you want to let your opinion known about the new design (nice! it sucks! meh.) feel free to hit me up too. If enough people kvetch, I’ll tweak it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy or something.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Douglas J Hunley</name><email>doug.hunley@gmail.com</email></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">UPDATE: I’ve switched out the theme entirely (again) so the CSS issues should no longer be present.

Nothing really significant or drastic, but things that have been on the TODO list for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the most obvious change would be that I added pagination finally. If you scroll the homepage all the way down, instead of it going back through the entire blog’s history, it stops after five posts, and then gives a clickable page counter. Once I had this implemented, I then had to un-paginate the archive pages which was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next most visible change would probably be the change I made to the CSS concerning CODE and CODEBLOCK. I’m still not 100% sure this is the final form, but I like it better than it was. For reference, it now looks like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My third change was to tweak the site’s header a bit. If you cast your gaze upwards, you can see that I now have ‘About’, ‘Archive’, and ‘Feeds’ in the header. The ‘Feeds’ link is new, as is the page that it links to. The actual RSS feeds themselves have existed for a while now, I just didn’t announce them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, I swapped out my photo for my new Bitmoji-based avatar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, uh, enjoy. Or something.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Douglas J Hunley</name><email>doug.hunley@gmail.com</email></author><category term="general" /><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">In case you haven’t already noticed, I’ve made some changes to my blog recently.

&lt;p&gt;That’s right, I’m running my own blog &lt;em&gt;once again&lt;/em&gt;. I know, I know. It’s been a while. And I’ve picked &lt;em&gt;yet another&lt;/em&gt; platform for hosting my blog. But you know what? You’re just going to have to suck it up. I’ve been itching to make some new posts for a while now, and the platforms at my disposal, &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;G+&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;, just haven’t really cut it. Sure, they sorta worked, but with the recent direction that platform is headed? Forget it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then a coworker mentioned standing up &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; new blog using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and I was blown away at how it worked. It just &lt;em&gt;so totally fit&lt;/em&gt; with my workflow and preferences. So here we are. Everything old is new again. Or something.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Douglas J Hunley</name><email>doug.hunley@gmail.com</email></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">Welcome to the new blog.</summary></entry></feed>
