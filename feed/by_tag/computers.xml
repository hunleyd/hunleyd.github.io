It’s not that the Pi is incapable or anything. I really like the platform and will probably find something else to use it for. But my computing needs/desires had changed and I was looking at having a small fleet of them (I already had 2 and was contemplating more) and I really didn’t want to go that route. So I looked around, did some research, saved up some money and ended up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/intel_nuc_8.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lleader&quot; /&gt;An Intel NUC 8 Performance-G Kit. \  This is a Core i7-based kit (NUC8i7HVK) that just needs RAM and storage added. It’s a Radeon RX Vega M GH 32GB video card, an 802.11{a,b,g,n} device, 2x Gb Ethernet, 2x USB 2.0 ports, 5x USB 3.0 ports. 2x HDMI ports, 2x mini-Display ports, 2x Thunderbolt 3 ports, and a Bluetooth 4.2 radio. All inside a 6.4 lb 10.8”x7.8”x4.8” case. I fricking love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put a pair of HyperX Kingston Technology Impact 16GB 2400MHz DDR4 sticks in it after talking myself down from a pair of 32GB sticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, I put in a pair of Samsung 970 PRO SSD 1TB M.2 NVMe SSDs (OK, that’s a lie. I went with just one initially, but bought a second one like a month later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the nature of the beast I’d assembled, I started with &lt;a href=&quot;https://clearlinux.org/&quot;&gt;ClearLinux&lt;/a&gt; as my OS. It’s &lt;strong&gt;stupid fast&lt;/strong&gt;. And it’s neat and interesting in that ‘not like other girls’ kinda way. Ultimately though, I ended up ditching it due to the state of packaging. I’ve read that they have some new packaging initiatives though so you shouldn’t rule it out based on my experience last year. I then move to Ubuntu LTS for a short while, realized my mistake, and am currently on Ubuntu Server. So far, it’s doing what I need it to do but, protip:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you google ‘how to X on ubuntu server’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just Google ‘how to X ubuntu’ then a lot of the time what you find won’t apply. Networking, for example, using something called &lt;a href=&quot;https://netplan.io/&quot;&gt;netplan&lt;/a&gt; which is nothing ike regular Ubuntu desktop networking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that’s all for now. I just wante to post this as background info cause I plan on posting about my travails w/ the Ubuntu Server as I go forward.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="computers" /><category term="linux" /><summary type="html">About a year ago (Sep 2019 to be precise) I decided to end my Raspberry Pi experiment and begin a new experiment with an Intel NUC.

And since the running of these scripts might be in the middle of the night, I like for them to email their output to me so I know if they succeeded or failed. As such, I need an MTA on my computer that can actually deliver these emails to GMail. For me, this is trivial using Sendmail or SSMTP on a Linux box, but I can never remember how to do this using Postfix on OSX. So after having to Google everything to get this running once more, I’m going to commit the steps here for my future self to reference :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we’re going to do is open an iTerm and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo -i&lt;/code&gt; to become root. Then we’re going to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vi /etc/postfix/main.cf&lt;/code&gt; and we’re going to add/set the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-conf highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;myhostname&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;smtp&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gmail&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;relayhost&lt;/span&gt; = [&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;smtp&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gmail&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;]:&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;587&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;smtp_sasl_auth_enable&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;yes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;smtp_sasl_password_maps&lt;/span&gt;= &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hash&lt;/span&gt;:/&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;postfix&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sasl_passwd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;smtp_sasl_security_options&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;noanonymous&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plain&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;smtp_use_tls&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;yes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have Two-Factor Auth (2FA) enabled on my Google account (you should too!), so for me, the next step is to log into Google and create an ‘app password’. Once I have that password in hand, we &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vi /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd&lt;/code&gt; and add:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-conf highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;smtp&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gmail&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;]:&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;587&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;@&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gmail&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;app_passwd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secure that file by running &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;chmod 0600 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd&lt;/code&gt; and then have Postfix hash it by doing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd&lt;/code&gt;. Finally, restart Postfix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;launchctl stop org.postfix.master
launchctl start org.postfix.master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And everything should work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="osx" /><category term="geek" /><category term="computers" /><summary type="html">Like most geeks, I have scripts that I’ve written that I like to have run from cron on a regular basis.

As you probably know, I spent a lot of time and effort on the previous mbp to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gentoo.org&quot;&gt;Gentoo&lt;/a&gt; up and running on it. I chose &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do so with this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I have looked into it and believe that I could get Gentoo up and running fairly easily, I’ve decided to skip it for now and try to live with OSX. I travel for work and never know what I’m going to be asked to do when onsite. Sometimes I have to present things on a projector while other times the customer only has 5Ghz wifi available. And thanks to the proprietary nature of these machines, these features are either non-functional or sub-optimal under Linux. I’m also getting tired of our IT staff telling me Linux isn’t supported whenever I have an issue, even if that issue clearly doesn’t have anything to do with the OS. And several other minor annoyances that have added up over my three yrs tenure here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yeah. I’ve decided to sign up for the pain of staying in OSX. So far, I think I’ve managed to coerce the system into a ‘feel-alike’ of my prior KDE 5 Plasma environment but it’s taken a lot of tweaking and Googling and setting of magic CLI commands to get OSX to do my bidding. And I’ve had to buy more than a few apps to get functionality that I got for free on Linux, which chaps my ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ll see how this lasts. Or doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="work" /><category term="computers" /><category term="osx" /><category term="linux" /><summary type="html">I recently got a new Macbook Pro from work as my old one was having keyboard issues and since it was 3+ yrs old they deemed it not worth fixing.
