version just in case I want to tinker with things further, but I could have
gone with the ‘Zen mode’ version just as easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ODROID-N2+ is remarkably capable and having the entire stack being
HA-managed (Home Assistant OS, running Home Assistant Supervisor, running Home
Assistant Core) is a dream. It really Just Works™ and I’ve not had any
issues over the few months it’s been running. I used the add-on store to have
it launch a MariaDB container and moved the ‘recorder’ component it with
a simple config tweak (and sped up startup time almost 4x in the process).
I’ve since added the community store (HACS) and a bunch of automations and it
still just keeps chugging along. At the moment, I’ve got 22 integrations, 49
devices, 10 areas, and ~372 entities and my system dashboard looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re considering taking the plunge into home automation, I can very
easily recommend getting a Blue.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Douglas J Hunley</name><email>doug.hunley@gmail.com</email></author><category term="smarthome" /><summary type="html">An update on my use Home Assistant, I’m no longer running it inside Podman as detailed here.

I ended up getting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0752V8D8D&quot;&gt;August Smart Lock Pro&lt;/a&gt; with the Connect module. Now that I’ve used it for a month and a half, I feel like I can finally review it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I love this lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, the hardest part of this whole process was picking the lock to buy. I looked at the August lock, I looked at the Kwikset Bluetooth lock, I even looked at the Nest lock and debating waiting for its release. In the end, I chose the August for two reasons: it integrates with Google Home natively (no ‘talk to August’ bullshit) and it uses the existing lock’s keys so my landlord can’t complain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing the lock was stupid simple. You are directed to download their app for your phone, create an account, and then it gives you full-screen step-by-step directions. There’s nothing unusual about this deadlock, so if you’ve ever changed one before, you know how to do this. You’ll need a screwdriver and maybe 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation is basically 4 steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove the old back on the deadbolt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find the correct shaft adaptor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install the new August back&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect to the wifi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t leave the house very often, if I’m honest, but the occasions I have since installing this have been very nice. I leave, the door locks (and thanks to other integrations my Blink cameras turn on); I return, the door unlocks (and the cameras turn off). I don’t have to carry a key with me. I don’t have to empty a hand to fish out my key to unlock the door. When I go to bed at night, I just tell Google to lock the door. The only minor annoyance is that Google won’t voice unlock the door (for security reasons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve yet to use the app to give anyone a ‘temporary key’ but I have used the app to check on (and change) the lock status. I’ve also used the app to update the firmware on the lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re considering a smart lock, I highly recommend you look at the August Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
