    <p><img src="http://www.theshell.guru/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/osx-logo3.png" border=0 align=right>I recently got a new Macbook Pro from work as my old one was having keyboard issues and since it was 3+ yrs old they deemed it not worth fixing. As you probably know, I spent a lot of time and effort on the previous mbp to get <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> up and running on it. I chose <em>not</em> to do so with this one.</p>

<p>While I have looked into it and believe that I could get Gentoo up and running fairly easily, I&#39;ve decided to skip it for now and try to live with OSX. I travel for work and never know what I&#39;m going to be asked to do when onsite. Sometimes I have to present things on a projector while other times the customer only has 5Ghz wifi available. And thanks to the proprietary nature of these machines, these features are either non-functional or sub-optimal under Linux. I&#39;m also getting tired of our IT staff telling me Linux isn&#39;t supported whenever I have an issue, even if that issue clearly doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the OS. And several other minor annoyances that have added up over my three yrs tenure here.</p>

<p>So, yeah. I&#39;ve decided to sign up for the pain of staying in OSX. So far, I think I&#39;ve managed to coerce the system into a &#39;feel-alike&#39; of my prior KDE 5 Plasma environment but it&#39;s taken a lot of tweaking and Googling and setting of magic CLI commands to get OSX to do my bidding. And I&#39;ve had to buy more than a few apps to get functionality that I got for free on Linux, which chaps my ass.</p>

<p>So we&#39;ll see how this lasts. Or doesn&#39;t.</p>
