    <p><a href="http://www.gethuawei.com/buy-huawei-watch"><img src="http://www.gethuawei.com/media/wysiwyg/pdpcms/huawei_watch/watches/stainless-leather1.png" width=150 height=197 border=0 align=left></a>A couple of my mates wanted me to let them know what I thought of the <a href="http://www.huawei.com/en/">Huawei</a> Watch (hereafter, &#39;H&#39;) after upgrading from the <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/products/moto-360">Moto 360</a> (hereafter, 360) and spending some time getting to know the &#39;H&#39;. So here&#39;s my thoughts.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Better than the 360 in every way that counts</p>

<p>I should probably preface this review by saying that I loved (and still love) the 360. I was excited to buy it, I was excited to see it ship to my house, I was pissed that I wasn&#39;t at my house when it arrived (long-term gig in LA), I was proud to wear it, and I loved showing it to anyone who cared (and probably more than a few who didn&#39;t). Having said that, the 360 I had was a Gen 1 in every sense. It was the first watch Moto had made. It was the first smartwatch Moto had made. It was the flagship Android Wear device. And the minute I got my hands on a 2<sup>nd</sup> gen device, those things were readily apparent.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. It&#39;s not all sunshine and roses w/ the &#39;H&#39;. For example, charging is actually quite a bit of a sorrier state than with the 360. You see, the 360 has a standard Qi charging mechanism. So while there is a cute little official charging stand, you can make do with <em>any</em> Qi charger you have once you figure out where to place the watch on the coil. And the official charger uses a standard, I-have-tons-of-them-all-of-the-place USB-A to USB-micro cable. The &#39;H&#39;, on the other hand, uses pogo pins to connect to it&#39;s charger. Which means you <u>have</u> to use a compatible charger (of which there is only one currently). Take a road trip and forget your charger? Buy another one or go without your watch. And to add to the insult, the charger cable, while having a standard USB-A plug on one end, is terminated inside the charging puck. So if the cord should go bad or isn&#39;t long enough, too bad. You can&#39;t use one of those USB cables from the pile in your desk drawer. Nope. Sorry. And then, of course, there&#39;s the <em>act</em> of charging the watch. With the 360, you simply slide it into its dock, and you&#39;re done. Heck, after a while, you can almost lightly toss it into the charger like a game of corn hole and it will charge. Half asleep? Drunk? No problem. Tis easy. The &#39;H&#39; on the other hand? You have to line up the pogos <b>exactly</b> or you aren&#39;t getting any juice. And I mean exact. Doesn&#39;t matter if the watch and the charger look perfectly aligned and centered with each other. If the pins aren&#39;t perfect, no juice for you! I&#39;ve already had my share of waking up to find out the watch didn&#39;t charge. It SUCKS.</p>

<p><em>Pro tip: I&#39;ve found that hovering the &#39;H&#39; right over the charging puck allows the magnets in them to pull them together in such a way that the puck &quot;leaps&quot; up and attaches to the watch with the pogo pins perfectly positioned</em></p>

<p>So yeah, charging. The one thorn in the rose. But worth it, imho.</p>

<p>Review: ★★★★★</p>
