    <title>Glutton for Punishment</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.theshell.guru/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/osx-logo3.png&quot; border=0 align=right&gt;I recently got a new Macbook Pro from work as my old one was having keyboard issues and since it was 3+ yrs old they deemed it not worth fixing. As you probably know, I spent a lot of time and effort on the previous mbp to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gentoo.org&quot;&gt;Gentoo&lt;/a&gt; up and running on it. I chose &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do so with this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I have looked into it and believe that I could get Gentoo up and running fairly easily, I&amp;#39;ve decided to skip it for now and try to live with OSX. I travel for work and never know what I&amp;#39;m going to be asked to do when onsite. Sometimes I have to present things on a projector while other times the customer only has 5Ghz wifi available. And thanks to the proprietary nature of these machines, these features are either non-functional or sub-optimal under Linux. I&amp;#39;m also getting tired of our IT staff telling me Linux isn&amp;#39;t supported whenever I have an issue, even if that issue clearly doesn&amp;#39;t have anything to do with the OS. And several other minor annoyances that have added up over my three yrs tenure here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yeah. I&amp;#39;ve decided to sign up for the pain of staying in OSX. So far, I think I&amp;#39;ve managed to coerce the system into a &amp;#39;feel-alike&amp;#39; of my prior KDE 5 Plasma environment but it&amp;#39;s taken a lot of tweaking and Googling and setting of magic CLI commands to get OSX to do my bidding. And I&amp;#39;ve had to buy more than a few apps to get functionality that I got for free on Linux, which chaps my ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;ll see how this lasts. Or doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
