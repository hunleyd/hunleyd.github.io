Hi, I'm Doug and I'm a Linux Sys Admin, Gentoo user, PostgreSQL advocate, Android fanboi, OSS supporter, and PlayStation gamer. But try not to hold all that against me, ok?

### More Information

This is my personal blog. There are many like it in the world, but this one is mine. It doesn't represent my current (or past) employers, or any organizations of which I'm a member. It's just me running my mouth about things that interest me or I feel need commented on. It's unfiltered and to-the-point, much like I am in person. I've been told that I am a master of [not giving a fuck](http://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck) and that is reflected in my musings here.

You've been warned.
