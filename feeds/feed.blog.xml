    <title>New look, same content</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lleader&quot; src=&quot;http://www.awesome-t-shirts.com/img/T-shirts/you-look-different-not-better-just-different.jpg&quot;&gt;As you&amp;#39;ve probably noticed, I&amp;#39;ve launched the new blog design. Everything that was here should still be here, but it might have moved. Sorry, but I broke the old permalinks. Bad blogger! However, I now have everything &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; where I want it, so it shouldn&amp;#39;t ever change again. Famous last words, right there :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway, let me know if you find issues w/ the site. I&amp;#39;m aware of some small CSS fuckery here and there, but I got tired of beating my head against it honestly. If anyone wants to tell me what&amp;#39;s wrong with it and how to fix it, I&amp;#39;ll buy you a virtual beer. If you want to let your opinion known about the new design (nice! it sucks! meh.) feel free to hit me up too. If enough people kvetch, I&amp;#39;ll tweak it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy or something.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Changes to the blog</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.cafecowboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/blogging-inside.gif&quot; border =0 align=right style=&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px&quot; height=200 width=200&gt;In case you haven&amp;#39;t already noticed, I&amp;#39;ve made some changes to my blog recently. Nothing really significant or drastic, but things that have been on the TODO list for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the most obvious change would be that I added pagination finally. If you scroll the homepage all the way down, instead of it going back through the entire blog&amp;#39;s history, it stops after five posts, and then gives a clickable page counter. Once I had this implemented, I then had to un-paginate the archive pages which was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next most visible change would probably be the change I made to the CSS concerning CODE and CODEBLOCK. I&amp;#39;m still not 100% sure this is the final form, but I like it better than it was. For reference, it now looks like &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My third change was to tweak the site&amp;#39;s header a bit. If you cast your gaze upwards, you can see that I now have &amp;#39;About&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Archive&amp;#39;, and &amp;#39;Feeds&amp;#39; in the header. The &amp;#39;Feeds&amp;#39; link is new, as is the page that it links to. The actual RSS feeds themselves have existed for a while now, I just didn&amp;#39;t announce them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, I swapped out my photo for my new Bitmoji-based avatar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, uh, enjoy. Or something.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Making use of gists</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5yjV3rrAvHk/U6Gm4-prTPI/AAAAAAAAJf4/7HXcjGxXGxI/s1600/logo_github_gist.png&quot; align=right border=0 width=218 height=59&gt; After stumbling upon an example of how to do so, I&amp;#39;ve converted all my existing blog posts to use GitHub Gists instead of inline code blocks. It gives me added functionality, and reduces the size of the blog pages as well. Might as well use every GitHub feature I can since I&amp;#39;ve chosen that platform for hosting my blog, right? :)&lt;/p&gt;
